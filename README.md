# World tree

## What am I looking for in a personal knowledge management (PKM) system?
* Ability to create arbitrary question types (Q&As, cloze deletions, image occlusions) for spaced repetition algorithms (modified SM-2 algorithm?)
* WYSIWYG interface. Information display should represent the hierarchy of information stored in the brain. The tight feedback loop between user input and output mimics “real world” interactions, developing a kinesthetic perspective on the content (like the tight, aesthetic feeling one receives when considering the visual boundaries of an idea). Ideally, this would be accomplished through a brain computer interface (BCI), or some interface that communicates information at the speed of thought.
* Easy control and analysis of data
* Integration or combination with other software pipelines
* Low priority: Ability to experiment with new PKM ideas (i.e. software)


## What would make me drop dead for a proprietary PKM system? 
* Shortens time between reading content and getting it into my brain
  * Could be done through
  * Brain-computer interface (BCI) input
  * Writes to my brain
  * Transcend limitations of the human brain; use a digital memory device that interfaces with the brain, or have an entirely different kind of brain

With current technology (laptops), it seems that note taking improvements will only be marginal. Tools that improve the actual processing and encoding of information seem to provide greater benefits. 

## Why is my time worth building a custom PKM system?

Quick effort (≤1 week creation time) + increased efficiency & benefits of learning + compounded over several years = a win?
